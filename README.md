# my-rossum-app
A simple app that uses the Rossum API

## Purpose

Part of Node.js developer hiring process is a requirement to create a simple web app that uses the Rossum API. 

The task description can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qIeffRqRqgc4kvGC0XvwfA-t_qtGAGXsxxGAjFMv7oU)

## My approach

- keep it simple, yet organized
- use linter, formatter & follow naming conventions
- use github-flow, pull-requests & link with issues
- involve a bit of functional programming
